Religious reformers pursue an analogous purification of the sacred texts, intent on restoring the lost inwardness and otherworldliness of Christian faith. Poets and prose writers challenge the rigid medieval dichotomy between the unsensual spirit and the unspiritual body, casting a newly loving eye on physical beauty and finding in human desire a privileged expression of the quest for intellectual and spiritual meaning.

By integrating classic readings in the discipline of sociology with the principles of global political economy, we will analyze and contextualize a range of social, economic, and political phenomena at the scales of the global, the national, the local, and the individual.', 'Title': "Think'g Global:Intro Sociology", 'Location(s)': ' ', 'Course': 'SOC 108 - 01', 'Day/Time': {'M': '09:50 am - 11:00 am', 'Th': '09:50 am - 11:00 am'}, 'Current Enrollment': '0', 'CRN': '13323', 'Prerequisite(s)': 'None'}, {'Distribution(s)': 'Social and Behavioral Analysis', 'Seats Available': '15 / 15', 'Description': ' This course is not intended to persuade you to choose, or dissuade you from choosing, a career in medicine.

More importantly the biographies narrated the lives of some of the most important members of medieval society.   Whether living or dead, saints were seen as liminal beings able to move between this world and the next, communicating God\xe2\x80\x99s will to their fellow Christians and harnessing divine power to perform miracles.  This course will examine the lives of a diverse group of male and female saints from the Middle Ages (c. 300-1300 C. E.), utilizing the sacred biographies both as a means for understanding medieval society and as a springboard for addressing larger issues connected to the aims and function of biographical writing and the question of whether or not an \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d biography is ever possible.', 'Title': 'Saints and Sinners', 'Location(s)': ' ', 'Course': 'WRIT 167 - 01', 'Day/Time': {'M': '01:30 pm - 02:40 pm', 'Th': '01:30 pm - 02:40 pm'}, 'Current Enrollment': '0', 'Instructor': 'Valerie Ramseyer', 'CRN': '13760', 'Prerequisite(s)': 'None.

Working in small teams, students will identify an area of need with their organization, gather information and research ways to best approach this issue, and write a grant seeking funding to address this area of need. At the conclusion of the course, students will fund one or more of these grants through a generous award from the Learning by Giving Foundation.
